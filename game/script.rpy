    Her skittery pace and piercing tone make me flinch in exasperation.
    nao "Don't call me that."
    omi "Darllingg dont be so harsh, Our names even rhyme. Its like we were meant to be ."

    nao "How'd you even get in? I'm pretty sure I locked the door last night."

    omi "Oh don't mind that, I just let myself with the spare key you leave under the rock"

    nao "Oh… I should change where I hide my spare better next time."

    omi "So are you ready???"

    scene bg black

    "The car ride on the way there could not have been longer."
    "I'm pretty sure if she had squealed a couple more times I wouldve crashed into the tree myself."
    "As the hospital was in sight, time somehow felt longer as I had to bear with the mobile chatterbox."

    scene bg hospitalOut

    "We parked around the corner of the block and walked towards the entrance of the hospital"
    "We were warmly greeted by the swinging glass doors of the medical instituition."

    scene bg hospitalRcpt

    "It looks somewhat overwhelming"

    "You look kinda lost"
    "Do you remember what room shes in???"

    "No…"

    "HEY, Don’t worry about it lets just go ask people who work here."

    "Well we just cant ask anyone."

    "Lets go find the receptionist then, kay?"

    "Yeah, ok."

    scene bg hospitalCorridor

    "Me and Naomi ask around the reception for a specific room number of our friend."

    "After a bit of back and forth we managed to finally come by their room number.
    "As we walk down the hallway, we turn quiet for whats about to come."

    "Nao, still remember the room number?"

    nao "Yeah , it was room number 4 if I remember."

    nao "Were here"
    nao "Are you ok Naomi?"

    "Yeah im ok."
    "Are you?"

    nao "Well, Ill have to be."

    scene bg hospitalRoom

    "The door slowly opens into the windy room with the curtains breezing towards us they dance around as if theyre praying to some God for a miracle of some sorts."

    "There we have her, our dear friend splayed with her poor remains splayed all over the hospital bed."
    "Like a desecrated mummy wrapped up and with an expressionless gaze into the white wall in front of her."
    "Her eyes jolt from the thousand yard stare into me and Naomi’s souls as we appear into sight."
    <Fear>
    "She starts flailing with her limbless arms and starts screaming with incorrigible words."

    "Josie is disturbed. It's as if she saw a monster and lost all sense of humanity."
    "It was like watching an animal being slaughtered, Begging for its life."

    "The room is quickly filled with sounds of screaming and wails of pain that reminded me of Ichigo"

    "Oh my."

    "Oh God"

    "Gagging, holding in my reaction from painting the white tiles with my breakfast became harder with each second I stood there."

    "My knees felt weak and my world was spinning around violently."

    "The nurse rushes in and comforts Josie's episode"
    "-Calm down hun, shh shh shh, its alright,-"
    "you guys should leave for now. Come back tomorrow."

    "Me and Naomi leave the room in a mess with our backs turned against what was left of my friend."

    scene bg hospitalCorridor

    "Oh God, why her. What did we do to deserve this."
    "Its all my fault. If I had never eve-"

    "Shhhh, its not your fault. Don’t worry about it too much. At least shes still alive"

    "AT LEAST? LOOK AT HER. SHE CAN'T EVEN WALK ANYMORE LET ALONE TALK TO US."

    "We both stare in silence at the door as the awkwardness creeps in enough for her to make senseless noise again."

    "So Kitaro didn’t show up huh, Who would've thought. I guess the accident affected that crybaby more than you."

    "Sure."

    "Kitaro walks in"

    "Heard my name at the edge of the corridor"
    "whats up?"

    "Speak of the Devil"

    "what were you saying about me again?"

    "ABOUT HOW NICE, SWEET AND BRAVE YOU ARE."

    "Sure"
    "sure, anyway"

    "hey, since I was late and all. Wanna get dinner at my place? my treat."

    "Sorry I cant, I have to go now. I have somewhere to go this evening."

    "oh wow okay, So I guess it's like that then."

    "Well, anyway"

    "BYEEEE NAOKI, SEE YOU TOMORROWWWW"
    "ILL MISSS YOUUUU"

    "I guess its just you and me then."

    "Guess so"

    "So"
    "you free to come over?"
    "im gonna grab some takeaway steak."

    "fine"

    scene bg car

    "We take a car to his place and have a steak dinner that we got from petes steakout house."

    "Kitaro bragged about all the things he bought or flaunted to other people during the entire car ride."
    "I guess I'm now one of those victims."

    "We get off the vehicle that he praises so much and into the walkway of his modern bungalow"

    "hey make yourself at home Kieta."

    "Okay."

    "As I take off my shoes and leave them by the entrance."
    "Kitaro initiates small talk in order to make me feel less awkward around him."
    "As we exchange common questions back and forth, he starts to set the table for dinner."

    "So what have you been up to this past month?"

    "Ive just been sleeping in from time to time. Trying to wrap my head around everything."

    "Well just to remind you, I lost more that day than you. I lost my Boat remember?"
     "But I still cant believe that Ichigo is gone now, It was so sudden"

    "That line struck you enough to catch your attention."
    "Just hearing her name was enough for you to remember her"
    "It sends you to reminisce memories with her"

    "Hi Naoki"

    "Ichigo…."

    "do you miss me already?"

    "Why did you leave me…"

    "That wasn't my choice to make."
    "It was simply my time."

    "BUT I'M NOT READY TO LET YOU GO"

    "Do you think you'll ever be ready?"

    "I- I don't know"

    "when you are."
    "I'll see you."
    "its like only I lost something that day"

    "That line snaps you back into reality."

    "hey!"
    "are you even listening to me?"
    "I cant believe I let you into my house, and forgive you for my boat."
    "And THIS is how you treat ME?"

    "Im so sorry."

    "Yeah, you should be."

    "huh."

    "If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened."
    "I would have been cruising the TROPICS by now."

    "…"
    "Lets not forget what happened to them"
    "I mean look at them, Naomi tries so hard to put up a front"
    "and Josie?"

    "SHE'S JUST LIVING BECAUSE NO ONES BRAVE ENOUGH TO SUGGEST EUTHANIZING THAT DEFORMED VEGETABLE."

    "why…"

    "WHAT'S WORSE. MY BOAT IS TRASHED AND THAT THORN OF A BITCH DIED ON MY PROPERTY."

    "I gripped my fork and knife pointed upward."
    "Gritting my teeth and glaring at him."

    "OH, SO NOW YOU'RE THREATENING ME?"

    "DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT IS TO STAGE ANOTHER MURDER AND BLAME IT ON SOME POOR GUY LIKE YOU?"

    "What."
    "Did"
    "You"
    "Say???"


    "OH"
    "haha, You weren't supposed to hear that."
    "A slip of the tongue I guess."
    "actually"
    "Sometimes."
    "i'm glad I killed that whore"
    "She annoyed me most when she resisted my advances"

    "Im going to kill him"

    "SO WHAT IF I TOLD YOU."
    "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"
    "YOU AND YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE GIRLFRIEND SHOULD HAVE DIED IN THE SAME DITCH"
    "WAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH"

    "I grip the knife that I was just cutting steak with in a firm manner."
    "And I pounce over the table knocking everything off of it,"
    "from the centerpiece to the dinner we just took a bite of."

    "He resists and strikes me in the liver with his fist."
    "I forgot he used to do Martial arts."

    "I plunge the steak knife deep into the side of his neck with his smug grin as it fades into an annoyed yet sly smirk."

    "Driving my hand repeatedly to do something that feels unjust and unnatural, the blood sputters out instead of the screams that would've been."

    "*Gurgled Laughing*"

    "The static ringing from the adrenaline and blinding rage numbs the facet of my actions"

    "A flurry of stabs missing the mark of his mouth to keep him from uttering anymore words and plenty to his heart to keep his vile body from doing anymore harm to anyone else."

    "It was like my hand was guided to his throat to cease him from sputtering anymore vile things."

    "I kept going."

    "Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again."
    "Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again."
    "Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again."
    "Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again."
    

    "Time has stopped."

    "Everything has frozen in place except the blood gurgling from his throat."

    "I got up from the ocean of blood that littered the dining room floor."

    "Staggering towards the kitchen sink."

    "I wash my hands of the guilt I have."

    "It won't come off"

    "I just keep washing with soap, with the sponge and with the steel wool. It just won't come off."
    "The blood is gone."
    "But my hands still feel slimy."
    "Its like im wearing hands that aren't mine. It feels so sickening, So unnerving."
    "No matter how much I keep scrubbing it wont come off."
    "My skin starts to peel as soon as I start using the steel sponge to clean my hands."

    "I got out of there."

    "I can’t sleep. My sins became physical and my morals abstract."

    "I still need to talk to Naomi tomorrow, I hope she gets better soon."

    "A sleepless night passes"

    "All the crosses your thoughts are the deeds of what you've done as the gravity of your actions drag you down deeper into the abyss of remorse and guilt."

    "Its all my fault. Why am I still alive."

    "I hear a knocking on the door this time."

    "Its naomi"
    "Her face looks morose."
    "Its like she hasnt gotten any sleep either."
    "Her eyes are puffy and nose riddled with snot bubbles."
    "NAOKKIIII"

    "Her tone seems more sullen than her usual bubbly demeanor."
    "Whats wrong?"

    "Its Kitaro naoki…."
    "Hes, hes dead"

    "Why. Even when hes gone he still haunting me. Why Me."

    "WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE"
    "HE WOULDNT EVEN HURT A FLY, SO WHY"
    "Hes riddled with holes, I cant even look at him without gagging"

    "Naoki gives Naomi a thousand year stare as she sobs"

    "Whats wrong, Why arent you saying anything?"
    "Kitaro was our friend, and hes just gone now"

    "…"

    "SAY SOMETHING PLEASE"
    "WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE JOSIE RIGHT NOW."
    "ALL GUYS EVER DO IS MAKE ME WORRY"

    "She cries out as she collapses on her knees crossed on the doorstep"
